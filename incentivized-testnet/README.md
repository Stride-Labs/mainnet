# PoolParty Bounty Tasks [Deprecated]

NOTE: PoolParty has ended, so you can no longer earn incentivized testnet rewards. This page is kept for historical purposes.

To earn rewards on the PoolParty testnet, submit evidence of having completed the following tasks. The goal is stress test the Stride core appchain and module logic. 

**Thoughtful, clear submissions will be rewarded ***far*** more than low-effort submissions, which will receive minimal rewards. You do NOT need to make a submission to earn rewards for running validators and relayers. We will detect your validators and relayers using onchain data.**


### Disclaimers
1. We will NOT verify your submission is valid until the incentivized testnet has finished.
2. The points listed in the task are the max you can earn for completing the task with high quality. Most submissions will earn fewer points for low quality, or no points if they violate the rules.
3. You will be asked to prove you own the address associated with the account that completed the task
4. You will be asked for several other verifications to prevent sybil attacks. 
5. Most tasks can only be completed once. Use your judgement (e.g. we will NOT reward you for delegating twice)
## How To Submit A Task
Please submit evidence you've completed a task using this [Mission/Appeals Submission](https://forms.gle/KG9vKb5fknqGYQRu9).

Use your best judgement to determine what constitutes proof you've completed the task (links to transactions/accounts and writeups are best; screenshots are acceptable but not ideal, other forms of evidence are unlikely to earn you rewards).  

### Questions?
Questions about incentivized testnet are ONLY allowed in the **#testnet-tasks** channel. **If you ask questions in other channels, you risk losing your incentives.**
