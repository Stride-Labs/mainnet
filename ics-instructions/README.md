# `stride-1`

# Section 1: Overview

Stride's launch on the Replicated Security will be different from other consumer chain launches. Other chain launches spawned a new chain from a fresh genesis state, but Stride already exists as a sovereign chain.

### Required tasks
At a high-level, as a validator, you have the following tasks. You *must* complete all 3 tasks.


1. Sync a stride-1 node ASAP (see step 1 below)
2. Complete key assignment ASAP and **before** the spawn time (or commit now to using your Cosmos Hub validator key). For emphasis, you must do key assignment or commit to using your Hub validator key **before** spawn time or there will be liveness issues with Stride.
3. Execute the Stride v12 upgrade on 2023-07-19, around 5pm UTC

Do these three tasks or the launch will fail!!!

### How will the sovereign -> consumer chain transition work on the Cosmos Hub?

* Stride side: Stride mainnet is currently live (chain-id: `stride-1`). Stride mainnet will perform a software upgrade and at the upgrade height (4616678) it will transition to the Cosmos Hub's validator set.
* Cosmos Hub side: A consumer-addition proposal to add Stride [has passed](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/799). Shortly after the spawn time (2023-07-19T05:00:00Z), validators will receive the CCV state. This CCV state will be used to patch the original stride chain‚Äôs genesis file, creating a new file: ccv.json. That will be pushed to this repo, after spawn time, but before the upgrade occurs. ccv.json must be placed in the node's home directory, in order to start a stride node after the upgrade to a consumer chain.

### What do you need to do to participate in the mainnet launch on 2023-07-19, around 5pm UTC?
See the table below for a breakdown of steps you'll need to follow throughout the process.

Optionally, you can generate `ccv.json` independently, like so (where genesis.json is Stride's genesis file)
```
gaiad q provider consumer-genesis stride-1 -o json > ccv-state.json
jq -s '.[0].app_state.ccvconsumer = .[1] | .[0]' genesis.json ccv-state.json > ccv.json
```

# Section 3: Key assignment 
**This is only relevant if you want to use a key that is different from your Cosmos Hub key.**


## IMPORTANT: ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you did not use the key assignment feature before spawn time, do not use it until the chain is live, stable and receiving VSCPackets from the provider! **‚ö†Ô∏è

This cannot be emphasized enough. Do _not_ try to do key assignment after the spawn time, but before Stride is ICS secured. You can do key assignment before spawn time, or 1 week after spawn time. This problem created liveness problems for Neutron.

If you do not wish to reuse the private validator key from your provider chain, an alternative method is to use multiple keys managed by the Key Assignment feature.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that the `priv_validator_key.json` on the consumer node is different from the key that exists on the provider node.

‚ö†Ô∏è The `AssignConsumerKey` transaction must be sent to the provider chain before the consumer chain's spawn time.

	# run this on the machine that you will use to run stride
	# the command gets the public key to use for stride
	$ strided tendermint show-validator
	{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"qVifseOYMsfeKnzSHlkEb+0ZZeuZrVPJ7sqMZJHAbBc="}
	
	# do this step on the provider machine
	# you should have a key available on the provider that you can use to sign the key assignment transaction
	$ STRIDE_KEY='{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"qVifseOYMsfeKnzSHlkEb+0ZZeuZrVPJ7sqMZJHAbBc="}'
	$ gaiad tx provider assign-consensus-key stride-1 $STRIDE_KEY --from <tx-signer> --home <home_dir> --gas 900000 -y -o json
	
	# confirm your key has been assigned
	$ GAIA_VALCONSADDR=$(gaiad tendermint show-address --home ~/.gaia)
	$ gaiad query provider validator-consumer-key stride-1 $GAIA_VALCONSADDR
	consumer_address: "<your_address>"

# Section 4: FAQ

**What are the latest instructions to join Stride mainnet as a node operator?**

Please see [here](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/tree/main/mainnet).

**If I‚Äôm currently a validator on Stride‚Äôs mainnet, can I reuse the same validator key for the consumer chain? Will I need to perform a AssignConsumerKey tx with this key before spawn time?**

Validators must either assign a key or use the same key as on the Cosmos Hub. If you are both a Stride and a Hub validator, you can use your current Stride key (you can do so by submitting a key assignment transaction with your current Stride validator keys).

**What will happen to the validator set on Stride‚Äôs original (sovereign) mainnet chain? Will the sovereign chain continue to operate?**

The sovereign chain will not operate (all blocks will be produced by Hub validators). Stride validators will become ‚Äúgovernors‚Äù and still can receive delegations. The expectation on governors is that they do NOT validate blocks, but they do the other functions of validators, including governance, running infrastructure, public education, business development, etc.

**Can I sync Stride mainnet without a snapshot?**

Yes, state sync is supported, but we‚Äôve found snapshots as the most reliable method. Many members of the Stride community consistently upload high-quality snapshots. A couple to highlight are [Polkachu](https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/stride) and [BccNodes](https://bccnodes.com/m/stride/#snapshot).

[This connection script](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/blob/main/mainnet/join_stride.sh) will automatically pull a recent snapshot and setup your node.¬†

**What should I set as the minimum commission rate?**

This is completely up to you, we‚Äôve found most validators set 5%.

**What channel will launch communications be in?**

Discord channel dedicated to Stride‚Äôs launch (in the #cosmos-hub Discord).
