# `stride-1`

Stride's launch on the Replicated Security will be different from other consumer chain launches. Other chain launches spawned a new chain from a fresh genesis state, but Stride already exists as a sovereign chain.

### Required tasks
At a high-level, as a validator, you have the following tasks. You *must* complete all 3 tasks.


If you don't complete all of the tasks, the launch will fail!!!

1. Sync a stride-1 node ASAP (see step 1 below)
2. Complete key assignment ASAP (or commit now to using your Cosmos Hub validator key)
3. Execute the Stride v12 upgrade on 2023-07-19, around 5pm UTC

Again, you must do these three tasks or the launch will fail!!!

### How will the sovereign -> consumer chain transition work on the Cosmos Hub?

* Stride side: Stride mainnet is currently live (chain-id: `stride-1`). Stride mainnet will perform a software upgrade and at the upgrade height (4616678) it will transition to the Cosmos Hub's validator set.
* Cosmos Hub side: A consumer-addition proposal to add Stride (has passed)[https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/799]. Shortly after the spawn time (2023-07-19T05:00:00Z), validators will receive the CCV state. This CCV state will be used to patch the original stride chain‚Äôs genesis file, creating a new file: ccv.json. That will be pushed to this repo, after spawn time, but before the upgrade occurs. ccv.json must be placed in the node's home directory, in order to start a stride node after the upgrade to a consumer chain.

### What do you need to do to participate in the mainnet launch on 2023-07-19, around 5pm UTC?
See the table below for a breakdown of steps you'll need to follow throughout the process. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Complete STEP 1 (join Stride testnet with a full node) ASAP ‚ö†Ô∏è
Follow along with Stride's block explorer here: https://www.mintscan.io/stride

For step 1, you can try using Stride‚Äôs joining script here: https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/blob/main/mainnet/join_stride.sh 

Otherwise you may manually join `stride-1` using these notes:
* Joining instructions: https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/tree/main/ics-instructions
* Genesis file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/main/mainnet/genesis.json
* Pre-transition stride binary commit: `4b5d80ac5cafb418debc8a860959d4a6c6797cfb`
* Stride‚Äôs GitHub repository: https://github.com/stride-Labs/stride
* Building instructions for stride‚Äôs binary: `make install`
* Go version: 1.19
* Seed id: ade4d8bc8cbe014af6ebdf3cb7b1e9ad36f412c0@seeds.polkachu.com:12256 
* Chain ID: `stride-1`
* Post-upgrade stride binary commit (run with this binary after the upgrade): [`POST_TRANSITION_HASH`](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride/commit/POST_TRANSITION_HASH)
  * You can use [this](https://storage.googleapis.com/strided-binaries/strided) pre-build linux binary. E.g. `wget -O strided 'https://storage.googleapis.com/strided-binaries/strided'`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride.git
cd stride
git checkout `4b5d80ac5cafb418debc8a860959d4a6c6797cfb`
make install
strided init stride-node --chain-id stride-1

# Grab the genesis file
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/main/mainnet/genesis.json -o $HOME/.stride/config/genesis.json
```

* Start stride node, node should start catching up
* Node will panic on 2023-07-19 around 5pm UTC at the upgrade height: 4616678
* Stop the node

Optionally, you can generate `ccv.json` independently, like so (where genesis.json is Stride's genesis file)
```
gaiad q provider consumer-genesis stride-1 -o json > ccv-state.json
jq -s '.[0].app_state.ccvconsumer = .[1] | .[0]' genesis.json ccv-state.json > ccv.json
```

# FAQ

**What are the latest instructions to join Stride mainnet as a node operator?**

Please see [here](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/tree/main/mainnet).

**If I‚Äôm currently a validator on Stride‚Äôs mainnet, can I reuse the same validator key for the consumer chain? Will I need to perform a AssignConsumerKey tx with this key before spawn time?**

Validators must either assign a key or use the same key as on the Cosmos Hub. If you are both a Stride and a Hub validator, you can use your current Stride key (you can do so by submitting a key assignment transaction with your current Stride validator keys).

**What will happen to the validator set on Stride‚Äôs original (sovereign) mainnet chain? Will the sovereign chain continue to operate?**

The sovereign chain will not operate (all blocks will be produced by Hub validators). Stride validators will become ‚Äúgovernors‚Äù and still can receive delegations. The expectation on governors is that they do NOT validate blocks, but they do the other functions of validators, including governance, running infrastructure, public education, business development, etc.

**Can I sync Stride mainnet without a snapshot?**

Yes, state sync is supported, but we‚Äôve found snapshots as the most reliable method. Many members of the Stride community consistently upload high-quality snapshots. A couple to highlight are [Polkachu](https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/stride) and [BccNodes](https://bccnodes.com/m/stride/#snapshot).

[This connection script](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/blob/main/mainnet/join_stride.sh) will automatically pull a recent snapshot and setup your node.¬†

**What should I set as the minimum commission rate?**

This is completely up to you, we‚Äôve found most validators set 5%.

**What channel will launch communications be in?**

Discord channel dedicated to Stride‚Äôs launch (in the #cosmos-hub Discord).
